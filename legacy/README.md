# Legacy MOVA 3.6.x Artifacts

This folder contains SmartLink artifacts based on **MOVA 3.6.x**.

These files are **archived** and no longer actively maintained.  
They are kept for historical reference and comparison purposes.

## What's here

All legacy schemas, examples, and documentation from the MOVA 3.6 era:

- `schemas/` — old ds.smartlink_rules_v1, env.smartlink_default_v1, etc.
- `mova-core/` — MOVA 3.6.0 core specifications
- `examples/` — old example instances

## Active development

**Current SmartLink development** is based on **MOVA 4.0.0**.

See:
- `../mova4-smartlink/` for new MOVA 4.0-based schemas and examples
- `../docs/SMARTLINK_SPEC_4.0.md` for updated specification
